# Singapore Pools TOTO Data Analysis
- Some fun project I decided to do during my free time and to practice Python
- Showcased the freqency of winning numbers and additional number
- Help determine which prize pool is worth buying based on prize per winner

- Issues
  1. Requires frequent dataset updates (twice per week)
  2. Certain prize pools are larger/smaller than expected and cannot confirm validity of data analysis due to lack of information
  3. Yet to do winning numbers prediction through other means like machine learning (future developments)
 
- Dataset
  - obtained from [lottolyzer](https://en.lottolyzer.com/history/singapore/toto)
